# Blackjack-game

Future Goals for this project are :
1. Update the Chips of Player (+25 - if BlackJack, -25 if the player gets out of the game)
2. Take Username and Password to enter the game and store the information in a database. Make it grab the database if same users logs back in.
3. Make an automated compatitor from which the user has to score more without getting out of the game. (Best the bot) If user beats the bot +25 in Chip for Player. 
4. Make a betting entery which Player will get if wins and deduct the same amount if player loses from the bot.
